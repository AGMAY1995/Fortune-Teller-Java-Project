# Fortune-Teller-Java-Project

#Based on the menu in this program, the user must enter two numbers and one letter. To this the program will then generate if the inputs are valid and if so it will give back a random fortune. If the user entered an invalid character the program will return a message asking to re-enter valid characters.
